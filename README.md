# &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Hello! I'm Yashaswini N L ðŸ‘‹    
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;A passionate data science enthusiast and learner.

The art of uncovering the insights and trends in data has been around since ancient times. The ancient Egyptians used census data to increase efficiency in tax collection and they accurately predicted the flooding of the Nile river every year. Since then, people using data to derive insights and predict outcomes have carved out a unique and distinct field for the work they do. This field is data science.In today's world, we use Data Science to find patterns in data, and make meaningful, data driven conclusions and predictions.
Data science combines math and statistics, specialized programming, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning with specific subject matter expertise to uncover actionable insights hidden in an organizationâ€™s data. These insights can be used to guide decision making and strategic planning.



### Here are some Hands on Projects that I have worked on during my learning process. ###
***These projects have been helping me to boost my data science knowledge to various learning levels.***
